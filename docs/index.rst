spiceminer documentation
========================

The spiceminer package is a high level python wrapper around
`NASAs CSPICE library <http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/>`_. It concentrates on
an easy to use API for analysing the data and doesn't include features to
manipulate or create data.

`You can get the source code here <https://github.com/DaRasch/spiceminer>`_.
